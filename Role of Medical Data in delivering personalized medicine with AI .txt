By using AI algorithms and Machine Learning, medical records can be used to obtain insights allowing personalized treatment. Medical records have detailed information about the patient, such as medical history, medications, and diagnoses. These records are analyzed through AI methods to look for patterns, predict disease progression and select the best treatment plan suited to each individual. AI algorithms are used to process the genomic data from the medical records to identify genetic variations with particular diseases and reactions to medicines for targeted therapies. It can also be used to predict potentially harmful events and identify the factors that could cause them.
