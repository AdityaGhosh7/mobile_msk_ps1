Here, we were first introduced to what Python is and how Python code gets executed. Then we brushed up with the basics of Python, such as the way of functions, parameters, return statement, string methods, Math functions, etc. Then we were taught the way of writing If statements and different types of loops, and how loops can be nested. Some essential concepts like lists, list methods, tuples, dictionaries, exception handling, and how to create reusable functions were taught. Finally, we learned about the OOP part of Python and topics like classes, constructors, inheritance, and modules and packages. We also made three tutorial projects as part of our learning, the code of which is present in the repository. It was a really comprehensive course, and I found it amazing to help me kickstart my journey with Python.
