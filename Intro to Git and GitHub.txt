Git is a decentralized and distributed version control system. Through this course, I obtained a comprehensive understanding of Git and GitHub, the important tools required for version control and collaborative software development. We were taught the basics of Git, such as setting up repositories, copying repository from GitHub to local computer using ‘git clone,’ commit, monitoring any changes and branching. We were taught some crucial topics like rebasing, settling disagreements, and using GitHub to manage remote repositories. I learned the method of creating branch, pull request collaboration and working efficiently on a project with the team. Some interesting features like creating a new repository locally and adding git to and existing project was also shown. Overall, this course helped me the knowledge I needed to use Git and GitHub effectively for software development projects.
