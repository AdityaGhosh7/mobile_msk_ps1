In this video, we were given a brief introduction to Python and the things we can do using Python. We were taught the basics of Python, like the concept of variables, receiving input, type casting, strings, etc. We learned about different arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators and their priority order over each other. We were then briefed about the usage and working of If statements, While Loops, For Loops, and the range() function. Finally, we learned about lists, list methods, and tuples and how lists and tuple differ from each other. Overall, it was an insightful course for a beginner in Python.
