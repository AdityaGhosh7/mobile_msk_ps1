Through this course, I learned the principles of creating Linux shell scripts. The course demonstrated fundamental ideas such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions in shell scripting including a thorough guide of the command-line interface. I gained a comprehensive understanding on using scripting to automate recursive activities, searching and modifying files and directories, and executing text processing. Efficient methods for organizing script, error handling and debugging were taught during the course. This course helped me obtain the knowledge and abilities required to efficiently build and execute shells scripts thereby increasing my experience and proficiency in Linux automation and administration.
